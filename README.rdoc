For the second week long project at CodeClan, I created a simple To Do List app for Android mobile devices.  The MVP was to have a top level of individual lists (ie. shopping list), which could then be opened to view another inner list (ie. egg, milk, bread etc.).  

The app was written in Android Studios, with Java as the base language, and SQLite to persist the data.
